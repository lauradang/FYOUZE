# FYOUZE

## What it is
FYOUZE is a networking tool in the form of both a web and mobile application that allows people to efficiently expand their social and professional circles and ground their various media platforms. When a user creates a FYOUZE account, they can connect it to their favourite social media apps – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. – so that all of their channels are conveniently grouped in one place. When two users connect on FYOUZE, they can seamlessly add one another on whichever media platforms they choose; this allows them to more effectively build their network and strengthen their relationships.
